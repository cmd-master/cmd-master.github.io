I help websites convert better through data analysis.

# How it works
## Step 1: Track Everything Important
First, we will track important touch points of customers in your website using Google Tag Manager.

## Step 2: Setup Accounts
All of this information will go to Google Analytics GA4 and BigQuery, which I will setup for you.

## Step 3: Create the one and only Dashboard you will ever need
Then, I will create customized dashboards for you to help you understand your customers better. No more filtering reports, setting up complicated code, this dashboard will be your one source of truth with all your important KPIs.
